  web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
        Web browsers
        receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them 
        into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically 
        and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
    <img src=1234.jpg.jpg width="10%"> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
        With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded 
        into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
        structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other 
        items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>
